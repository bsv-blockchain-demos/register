# Fraud Prevention System Enhancements

## Overview

The QuarkID fraud prevention system has been enhanced with production-ready security features, comprehensive demonstration capabilities, and real-time monitoring. This document summarizes the key enhancements made to the existing BBS+ selective disclosure ZKP system.

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ✅
- **Implementation**: Applied `requireActorRole` middleware to all fraud prevention endpoints
- **Security**: Each endpoint now restricts access to appropriate actor types
- **Coverage**:
  - `POST /prescription/create` → Doctors only
  - `POST /prescription/verify` → Pharmacies only  
  - `POST /dispensing/create` → Pharmacies only
  - `POST /insurance/verify` → Insurance companies only
  - `POST /audit/full-disclosure` → Auditors only

### 2. Rate Limiting ✅
- **Implementation**: Express rate limiting middleware applied to all fraud prevention routes
- **Configuration**: 
  - Window: 15 minutes
  - Limit: 100 requests per IP per window
  - Standard headers included
  - Custom error messages for API consistency
- **Security**: Protects against DoS attacks and brute force attempts

### 3. Real-Time Fraud Monitoring ✅
- **High Fraud Score Alerts**: Automatic warnings for fraud scores ≥ 50
- **Alert Types**:
  - `HIGH_FRAUD_SCORE`: Triggered during dispensing proof creation
  - `INSURANCE_FRAUD_DETECTED`: Triggered during insurance claim verification
- **Structured Logging**: Includes fraud score, timestamp, actor DIDs, and alert type
- **Monitoring Ready**: Logs are structured for integration with monitoring systems

### 4. Complete Workflow Demonstration ✅
- **Endpoint**: `POST /v1/fraud-prevention/demo/complete-workflow`
- **Scenarios**: 
  - `normal`: Standard workflow with legitimate prescriptions
  - `fraud`: Demonstrates fraud detection with overprescribing and missing patient confirmation
- **Workflow Steps**:
  1. Doctor creates prescription with BBS+ signature
  2. Pharmacy generates dispensing proof with fraud scoring
  3. Insurance company verifies claim using selective disclosure
  4. Selective disclosure demonstration for different actors
- **Output**: Comprehensive workflow results with privacy and security feature documentation

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "express-rate-limit": "^7.5.1"
}
```

### Key Code Changes

#### Rate Limiting Implementation
```typescript
const fraudPreventionLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100,
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false,
  message: {
    success: false,
    error: 'Too many fraud prevention requests from this IP, please try again after 15 minutes'
  }
});
```

#### Fraud Monitoring
```typescript
if (result.fraudScore >= 50) {
  console.warn(`[FRAUD ALERT] High fraud score detected: ${result.fraudScore}`, {
    pharmacyDid,
    prescriptionCredentialId,
    fraudScore: result.fraudScore,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    alert: 'HIGH_FRAUD_SCORE'
  });
}
```

## API Documentation Updates

### New Endpoints
- `POST /v1/fraud-prevention/demo/complete-workflow` - Complete workflow demonstration

### Enhanced Documentation
- Added fraud prevention features section in API root documentation
- Documented security, privacy, compliance, and demonstration capabilities
- Updated endpoint descriptions to reflect RBAC requirements
